# Searching_-_Sorting_Methods

### **Searching Algorithms:**
1. **Linear Search** – Checks each element sequentially until the target is found.
2. **Binary Search** – Efficiently searches a sorted array by repeatedly dividing it in half.
3. **Jump Search** – Skips fixed steps in a sorted array and then performs linear search.
4. **Interpolation Search** – An improvement over binary search, estimating the position based on value distribution.
5. **Exponential Search** – First finds a range where the target exists and then applies binary search.

### **Sorting Algorithms:**
1. **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort** – Finds the smallest element and places it in the correct position iteratively.
3. **Insertion Sort** – Builds a sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct positions.
4. **Merge Sort** – Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.
5. **Quick Sort** – Uses a pivot to partition the array and recursively sorts both partitions.
6. **Heap Sort** – Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
7. **Counting Sort** – Counts occurrences of each element and places them accordingly.
8. **Radix Sort** – Sorts numbers digit by digit from least to most significant.
9. **Bucket Sort** – Divides elements into buckets, sorts them individually, and merges.
10. **Shell Sort** – An optimized version of insertion sort using gaps.
